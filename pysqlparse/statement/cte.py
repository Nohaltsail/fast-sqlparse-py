    """
    Common Table Expression (CTE) parser and manipulation class.

    This class provides comprehensive parsing and formatting capabilities for SQL WITH clauses,
    also known as Common Table Expressions. It supports both simple and recursive CTEs,
    enabling programmatic analysis and transformation of temporary result sets in SQL queries.

    Key Features:
    - Full CTE statement parsing (WITH clause extraction)
    - AST generation for structural analysis
    - SQL formatting with customizable indentation
    - Token-level access for advanced processing

    Supported CTE Syntax:
    - Simple CTEs: WITH cte_name AS (SELECT ...)
    - Multiple CTEs: WITH cte1 AS (...), cte2 AS (...)
    - Recursive CTEs: WITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (...)
